First post! I've finally decided to return to blogging, or at least to give it a try. The idea is to document my ideas, projects and failures.

I'll be using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the site and [GitHub's pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages) to host it.
